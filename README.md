# Average-Unit-shipped
create a windows application in C# to calculate the average number of units shipped per week.
Your company has been contracted to create a windows application in C# to calculate the
average number of units shipped per week.
Your solution will take an input for each day in the week numbered from 1 to 7. The user input data will
need to be validated and, if it passes validation, the data will need to be displayed to the user. Once the
number of units has been entered for the 7th day the solution will calculate and display the average to
the user.
As well, the solution will not allow the user to strike the enter key or input any more data until the form
is Reset/Cleared.
The solution should also allow the user to exit the program regardless of the state of the form, in other
words. The user can exit at any time.
